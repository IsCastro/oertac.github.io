# Prototype 3D Web App for BIM and GIS Collaboration
## Esri ArcGIS Online and Autodesk A360 in a single 3D web app!

This 3D web application is a prototype for interactive 3D visualization using two different web platforms from Esri (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html">ArcGIS Online</a>) and Autodesk (A360) on the web based ArcGIS Javascript API. The application visualizes a Building Information Modeling (BIM) project by combining 3D Web Viewer from ArcGIS Online and 3D Viwer from A360. The view on the right is the engineering view of the 3D object. 3D Web Scene on the left gives the context with all surrounding information in a 3D GIS.<br>

Its purpose is to give access to the code base and to show how the application was implemented with the ArcGIS Javascript API and HTML. To learn more about the background and data processing as well as details and challenges about the implementation, review the <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/index.html">samples</a> in https://developers.arcgis.com.

It's not an officially supported workflow, but with the help of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.esri.com/landing-pages/autodesk-esri-strategic-alliance">the strategic alliance between Esri and Autodesk</a>, we're hoping to have standard interfaces between these web platforms.

## Project Details
Purpose of the project is an eight-lane expansion of highway A99 between interchange Munich North and the junction Haar with a length of 18.6 km. Besides renovation of bridges and superstructure also noise abatement measures are planned.

The focus of this pilot project are future requirements for a frictionless information sharing between engineers and environmental planners, to optimize all required environmental concerns from the start of planning via project implementation through to completion and to monitor the environmental measures.
