# Web scene - slide tour

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oertac/oertac.github.io/master/3D-Slidetour/img/webscene_slides.png)

This sample demonstrates how to create an animated tour of the slides in a WebScene by using the applyTo() method. applyTo() returns a promise that resolves after the slide has been applied to the view. By chaining the applyTo() method of the slides, we can play through all the slides without user input.
